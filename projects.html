                <h3>Crime Records Digitalization</h3>
                <p>This is my team's main-project which we have submmited in our final year. As now a days, digitalization is taking place in almost all in every sector. But in police stations,  we are still using traditional paper record system. To bring a change in the traditional system, we design a web application which is capable of performing OCR on all documents either printed or typed. It would convert the scanned documents into text and extract key information from it and store in the database. The Investigation Leads would be identified and would be pushed to Investigation Officer, Volunteers, Observers or the stakeholders as the case. So, the crime department can carry-on investigation of the case. The application should even generate the hash value for image so that we can maintain integrity for the data so with it we would use  it in the court as digital evidence.</p>
